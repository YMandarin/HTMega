# Diploma Thesis: HTMega

The Goal of this Thesis is to develop and create a custom and functional microcontroller on an FPGA.

You can find the thesis paper in [Thesis.pdf](Thesis.pdf).

### The project consists of:
- The fpga configuration for an Xilinx Artix-7 development board, written in VHDL and developed with Xilinx Vivado.
- An assembler for the custom instruction set, written in C#.
- A VSCode highlighter extension that helps in writing the assembly code.
