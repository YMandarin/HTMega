Configuration bank voltage select (CFGBVS) must be set to VCCO or GND, and CONFIG_VOLTAGE must be set to the correct configuration voltage, in order to determine the I/O voltage support for the pins in bank 0.

If there is no registered adder/accumulator following the multiply function, two pipeline stages are suggested to allow both the MREG and PREG registers to be used.  If the DSP48 was instantiated in the design, it is suggested to set both the MREG and PREG attributes to 1 when performing multiply functions.
WARNING: [DRC DPOP-2] MREG Output pipelining: DSP ALU/Q_MULS0 multiplier stage ALU/Q_MULS0/P[47:0] is not pipelined (MREG=0). Pipelining the multiplier function will improve performance and will save significant power so it is suggested whenever possible to fully pipeline this function.  If this multiplier was inferred, it is suggested to describe an additional register stage after this function.  If there is no registered adder/accumulator following the multiply function, two pipeline stages are suggested to allow both the MREG and PREG registers to be used.  If the DSP48 was instantiated in the design, it is suggested to set both the MREG and PREG attributes to 1 when performing multiply functions.
WARNING: [DRC PDRC-153] Gated clock check: Net BootLoaderI/Receiver/counter[3]_i_2__1_n_0 is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin BootLoaderI/Receiver/counter[3]_i_2__1/O, cell BootLoaderI/Receiver/counter[3]_i_2__1. This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.
WARNING: [DRC PLHOLDVIO-2] Non-Optimal connections which could lead to hold violations: A LUT BootLoaderI/Receiver/counter[3]_i_2__1 is driving clock pin of 24 cells. This could lead to large hold time violations. Involved cells are:
BootLoaderI/Receiver/FIFO_reg[0], BootLoaderI/Receiver/FIFO_reg[1], BootLoaderI/Receiver/FIFO_reg[2], BootLoaderI/Receiver/FIFO_reg[3], BootLoaderI/Receiver/FIFO_reg[4], BootLoaderI/Receiver/FIFO_reg[5], BootLoaderI/Receiver/FIFO_reg[6], BootLoaderI/Receiver/FIFO_reg[7], BootLoaderI/Receiver/counter_reg[0], BootLoaderI/Receiver/counter_reg[1], BootLoaderI/Receiver/counter_reg[2], BootLoaderI/Receiver/counter_reg[3], BootLoaderI/Receiver/data_reg[0], BootLoaderI/Receiver/data_reg[1], BootLoaderI/Receiver/data_reg[2]... and (the first 15 of 24 listed)
