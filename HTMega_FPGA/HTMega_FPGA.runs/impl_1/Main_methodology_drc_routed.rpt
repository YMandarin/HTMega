LUT on the clock tree  
The LUT BootLoaderI/Receiver/counter[3]_i_2__1 has been found on the clock tree. Run opt_design to optimize the clock trees, then re-run report_methodology.

TIMING-56#1 Warning
Missing logically or physically excluded clock groups constraint  
Multiple clocks are user generated or auto-derived on the source pin Clock/inst/mmcm_adv_inst/CLKFBOUT but are not logically or physically exclusive with respect to one another. To have the static timing analysis match the behavior in hardware, there cannot be multiple clocks generated on the same pin and when such situation occurs, the clocks should be defined as physically or logically exclusive. The list of clocks generated on the source pin is: clkfbout_SysClkWizard, clkfbout_SysClkWizard_1
